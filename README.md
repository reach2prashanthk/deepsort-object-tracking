# deepsort-object-tracking
Our project focuses on the development of a robust human tracking system designed to monitor pedestrian movement in urban environments. Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, including the DeepSORT (Deep Learning for Multi-Object Tracking) algorithm, our system aims to accurately detect and track individuals
